<p id="description">BadgeBoard-DAO is an on-chain governance prototype designed for small communities and subDAOs. It runs on the Core Testnet and uses a 5-of-9 multisig council for decentralized proposal approval and execution. 🔍 Overview Network: Core Testnet DAO Contract: 0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138 Balance: 5.0001 tCORE Explorer: View on CoreScan ⚙️ Features Component Description 🧑‍⚖️ CouncilDAO Multisig DAO with 5-of-9 approval system 🔐 Member Rotation Council can vote to replace members 📜 Proposal Logic Submit arbitrary encoded function calls 🔐 Secure Voting Only whitelisted council members can vote ⛓️ On-chain Execution Automatically executed when 5 approvals are met 🧪 Testnet Deployment Core Chain: Core Testnet Faucet Gas Token: tCORE Contract deployed using Remix IDE Uses constructor input: solidity Copy Edit [ "0x1111..." "0x2222..." ... "0x9999..." // total 9 members ] 📂 Contract File CouncilDAO.sol: Solidity ^0.8.0 Fully compatible with Remix IDE No external dependencies (uses native Solidity logic) 📦 Example Usage ✅ Council member submits proposal: Example: transfer funds call another contract 🗳️ Members approve the proposal (must reach 5) 🤖 Once approved it's automatically executed 🔒 Security Notes Avoid reusing council member addresses on mainnet Ensure encoded data is validated off-chain before submitting Always test on testnet before migrating to mainnet 🛠️ Future Upgrades UI frontend for interacting with proposals Modular plugins (e.g. Badge NFTs Role-gating Snapshot voting) Chainlink automation for auto-execution 🤝 Credits Built using Core Chain Testnet Developed and tested on Remix IDE</p>
